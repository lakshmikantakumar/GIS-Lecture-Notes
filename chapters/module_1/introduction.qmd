## FOSS

Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) refers to software released under a license that grants users essential freedoms to run it for any purpose, 
examine how it works, adapt it to their needs, and share it, whether in its original form or with modifications, without limitations or fees. 
The term “FOSS” blends two closely related ideas: free software, which focuses on user rights and collaborative ownership, and open-source software, 
which stresses transparency and community-driven development.

## Free Software ≠ Open Source

Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Movement, points out that while “free software” and “open source” often describe the same kind of programs, they are 
based on different ideas.  

- **Free software** is about *freedom* making sure people control the software they use.  
- **Open source** is more about *practical benefits* like better quality and faster development, without focusing much on the moral side  
([gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org)).

## The Four Freedoms of Free Software

“Free” here means *freedom*, not zero cost. Free software means you can:

- **Freedom 0** : Use the program however you want.  
- **Freedom 1** : Look at the code and change it to fit your needs.  
- **Freedom 2** : Give copies to anyone.  
- **Freedom 3** : Share your improved versions with others.

## A Short History

- **1983** : The Free Software Movement began with the GNU Project and a license (GPL) that made sure these 
freedoms were protected ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project)).  
- **1998** : Some in the community started calling it “open source” to make the idea sound more appealing to businesses. 
This approach often skipped talking about the moral side of software freedom ([gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org)).

## The Open Source Definition (OSD)

The **Open Source Definition (OSD)**, managed by the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](https://opensource.org), explains what counts as open-source software. 
Created in **2006** and last updated in **February 2024**, it lists **ten rules** that go beyond just sharing the code. Open Source software means you can:

- **Free sharing** : no fees or restrictions.  
- **Source code included** : in a form you can read and edit.  
- **Changes allowed** : you can make and share new versions.  
- **Works on any tech** : no limits based on platform or hardware.  

These rules make sure open-source software stays free to **use**, **change**, and **share**, giving a clear and trusted meaning for developers, communities, and businesses.

## Different Ways of Thinking

While both groups create similar kinds of software, they make choices differently:

- **Open source thinking:** “Is this the best tool for the job?”  may use closed, paid software if it’s more convenient.  
- **Free software thinking:** “Does this respect my freedom?”  avoids closed software even if it’s technically better.

## Comparison: Free Software vs Open Source  


| Aspect                 | Free Software                                                | Open Source Software                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emphasis**           | Focuses on **freedom** (user rights)                         | Focuses on **development model** and practical benefits   |
| **Founded by**         | Richard Stallman (Free Software Foundation - FSF)            | Eric Raymond & Bruce Perens (Open Source Initiative - OSI)|
| **Core Idea**          | Users should control the software they use                   | Open code leads to better, more reliable software         |
| **Terminology**        | "Free" means freedom, not price ("free as in freedom")       | "Open Source" avoids the ambiguity of the word "free"     |
| **Ethical Standpoint** | A **moral and social movement**                              | A **development methodology**                             |
| **Licensing**          | Requires **copyleft licenses** (e.g., GPL) to protect freedom| Accepts **permissive licenses** (e.g., MIT, BSD, Apache)  |
| **Goal**               | Empower users with freedoms to use, study, modify, share     | Promote wider adoption of open development practices      |
| **Tone & Messaging**   | Often ideological                                            | Often pragmatic and business-friendly                     |

## Conclusion
Free and Open-Source Software represents more than just a different way to build and share code, it reflects two complementary philosophies that have shaped modern software culture. 
While the Free Software movement champions user freedoms as a moral imperative, the Open Source approach emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and practical benefits. 
Together, they have fostered a global ecosystem where knowledge is openly shared, innovation thrives, and communities,from hobbyists to governments can create, adapt, and distribute 
technology without restrictive barriers.
